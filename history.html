This exercise was carried Arthur Mbanefo’s Committee on States and Local Government creation in the country.
During the exercise, the present Mashegu Local Government, was carved out from Wushishi local government, to form one of the six newly create local government in the state in addition to the nineteen existing ones. This increased the number of local government in the state to its present twenty five.
before that balkanization, the defunct Wushishi local government itself was create on august 27, 1991, during the regime of General Ibrahim BadamasiBabangida from the yet defunct Mariga Local government with headquarters at Kontagora. </h4><hr>

TOURSIM 
</div>
<div class="imagine">

<hr> <h4> Arguably, the most notable place for tourism in the local government is Zungeru, the second most populous town in the area. It played a significant role in shapping the political history of Nigeria. <br>
  It was at zungeru that the amalgamation of both the Northern and the Southern protectorate took place in Febuary 1914, by Lord Frederick Lugard. Largely because of this, the town become the first capital of Nigeria, a status she enjoyed for seven months (February 1914, - August 1914). But even before this development, it was the capital of northern Nigeria, and had occupied this position from 1902-1916, when the capital was finally moved to Kaduna by the colonial masters. Relics of the structures put in place by the British are somewhat preserved by the state government and is now one of the main tourist attractions in the state. <br>
  Another interesting thing to know about Zungeru is that was in the town that the British Royal Niger Constabulary Force were merged with officers from other units to form what was then known as the West Africa Frontier force ( W.A.F.F), in 1897. The conquest of Northern Nigeria was made possible through the use of this force by the British. The plans for the capture of prominent Northern towns such as Bauch, Kano and Sokoto, were conceived and launched in Zungeru. The W.A.F.F. Barracks, as well as other military installations of the forces, are still being preserved by the state government as yet another tourist point in the state. <br>
  The town is also the birth-place of some of Nigeria’s most notable personalities.The first indigenous Governor –General, later first president of the federal Republic of Nigeria, the Owelle of Onitsha, Late Dr. NamdiAzikiwe, was born in Zungeru. <br>
  A village called 30km away from Wushishi, the local government Headquarters, served as a port for the British Royal Niger Company (R.N.C.). commercial goods and other materials used in the crection of the new Capital at Zungeru, were transported through rails from the village to the town. Remnants of the R.N.C. structure can still be found in the village. The tomb of a famous nomadic Islamic Scholar, ShehuAbdulraman, is at Cheji, 35 km away from Wushishi. He lived in the area. Propagating Islam during the time of the Fulani Jihadists. His tomb in the village is visited by Muslim faithful from far and near, and a mosque was built by the present local government council by the side of his tomb. His foot-print is reported to have appeared  on a rock at Gwasakun, 50 Km away from Wushishi, and is preserved by the natives. <br>
  The rocks at the proposed site for the construction of a Hydro-electric dam at Zungeru, serves as another tourist point in the area. The natural physical features of the rocks provide great delight for tourists who visit the local government. Fishing festival at Ndiga Village
