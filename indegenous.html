  (born 17 August 1941) is a Nigerian retired general and statesman who
  served as military president of Nigeria from 1985 until his resignation in 1993. He rose through the ranks to
  serve from 1984 to 1985 as Chief of Army Staff, going on to orchestrate his seizure of power in a coup d'état
  against Muhammadu Buhari.<br>
  He rose through the ranks of the Nigerian Army fighting in the Nigerian Civil War and at various times being
  involved in almost all the military coups in Nigeria, before advancing to the full-rank of a General and ultimately
  as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces; and as an unelected President and military dictator from 1985 to
  1993, ruling for an uninterrupted period of eight years. His years in power, colloquially known as the Babangida
  Era, are considered one of the most controversial in Nigerian political and military history, being
  characterized by a burgeoning political culture of corruption in Nigeria,with Babangida and his regime
  estimated at least 12 billion dollars (23.9 billion today).<br>
  The Babangida regime oversaw the establishment of a state security apparatus; survived two coup d'ètat attempts
  and the subsequent execution of Mamman Vatsa (1985) and Gideon Orkar (1991) alongside the trial of hundreds
  of soldiers; assassination in Lagos of Dele Giwa (1986). The regime also faced a series of ethnic and religious
  outbreaks related to the fallout of Babangida's decision to increase cooperation with the Muslim world and rise
  in extremist tendencies. On the continent his rule projected the country as a regional power with diplomatic
  successes including the Abuja Treaty and the military engagement of Nigerian troops in Liberia and Sierra
  Leone.<br>
  Abroad, Babangida's military regime cemented traditional relations with the English-speaking world of the
  United States and United Kingdom; and implemented economic liberalization and the privatization of stateowned enterprises alongside a national mass mobilization. The fall of Babangida and his regime was precipitated
  by the transition towards the Third Nigerian Republic and subsequent militarization of politics in the 1993
  presidential election which Babangida annulled.<br>
  
  <span> <u> EARLY LIFE </u>    </span>  <br>
  Ibrahim Babangida was born on 17 August 1941 in Minna to his father, Muhammad Babangida and mother
  Aisha Babangida. He received early Islamic education before attending primary school from 1950 to 1956.
  From 1957 to 1962 Babangida attended Government College Bida, together with classmates Abdulsalami
  Abubakar, Mamman Vatsa, Mohammed Magoro, Sani Bello, Garba Duba, Gado Nasko and Mohammed Sani
  Sami. Babangida joined the Nigerian Army on 10 December 1962, where he attended the Nigerian Military
  Training College in Kaduna. Babangida received his commission as a second lieutenant as a regular combatant
  officer in the Royal Nigerian Army (a month before it became the Nigerian Army) with the personal army
  number N/438 from the Indian Military Academy on 26 September 1963. Babangida attended the Indian Military Academy from April to September 1963.<br>
  He was Commanding Officer of 1 Reconnaissance Squadron from 1964 to 1966. From January 1966 to April 1966, Babangida attended the Younger Officers Course at the Royal Armoured Centre in the United Kingdom –
  where he received instruction in gunnery and the Saladin armored car. Lieutenant Babangida was posted with the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron in Kaduna, and witnessed the events of the bloody coup d'état of 1966, which
  resulted in the assassination of Sir Ahmadu Bello. Alongside several young officers from Northern Nigeria, he took part in the July counter-coup led by Murtala Mohammed which ousted General Aguiyi Ironsi replacing him with General Yakubu Gowon.<br>
  <span> <u> MILITARY CAREER </u>    </span>  <br>
  <span> <u> CIVIL WAR </u>    </span>  <br>
  Further information: Nigerian Civil War
  Following the outbreak of the civil war, Babangida was recalled and posted to the 1st Division under the
  command of General Mohammed Shuwa. In 1968, he became commander of the 44 Infantry Battalion which
  was involved in heavy fighting within Biafran territory. In 1969, during a reconnaissance operation from Enugu
  to Umuahia, the battalion came under heavy enemy fire and Babangida was shot on the right side of his chest.
   He was then hospitalized in Lagos, and was given the option of removing the bullet shrapnel, which he
  refused and still carries with him.[14] Away and recovering from his wounds, Babangida married Maryam King
  on 6 September 1969. He returned to the war front in December 1969, commanding a battalion. In January
  1970, Babangida was informed by his sectional commander General Theophilus Danjuma of the capitulation of
  the Biafran Army to the federal military government in Lagos, signaling the end of the war.<br>
  <span> <u> AFTER WAR </u>    </span>  <br>
  In 1970, following the war Babangida was promoted twice and posted to the Nigerian Defence Academy as an
  instructor. From August 1972 to June 1973, he attended the Advanced Armoured Officers Course at the United
  States Army Armor School. In 1973, he was made commander of the 4 Reconnaissance Regiment. In 1975, he
  became the commander of the Nigerian Army Armoured Corps. Babangida attended several defence and strategy
  courses. Colonel Babangida as Commander of the Armoured Corps was a key participant in the coup d'état of
  1975.<br>
  He was later appointed as one of the youngest members of the Supreme Military Council from 1 August 1975 to
  October 1979. Colonel Babangida crushed almost single-handedly the coup d'état of 1976 that resulted in the
  assassination of General Murtala Mohammed by taking back control of the Radio Nigeria station from the main
  perpetrator, Lieutenant Colonel Buka Suka Dimka. From January 1977 to July 1977, he attended the Senior
  Officers Course at the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji. From 1979 to <br>
  <span> <u> ARMY STAFF HEADQUATER </u>    </span>  <br>
  Babangida was the Director of Army Staff Duties and Plans from 1981 to 1983.
   He orchestrated the coup d'ètat of 1983 which led to the overthrow of the Second Republic, with financial backing from his close associate
  and businessman Moshood Abiola. Babangida alongside his other co-conspirators later appointed the most senior serving officer at the time General Muhammadu Buhari as military head of state from 1983 to 1985; and
  Babangida was promoted and appointed as Chief of Army Staff and member of the Supreme Military Council.<br>
  
  <span> <u> PLANNING </u>    </span>  <br>
  Following the coup d'état of 1983, General Babangida (then Chief of Army Staff) started scheming to overthrow
  military head of state General Muhammadu Buhari. The palace coup of 1985 was orchestrated with a degree of
  military deftness hitherto not seen in the history of coup plotting. The whole affair carried out by Babangida as
  ringleader was planned at the highest levels of the army cultivating his strategic relationship with allies: Sani
  Abacha, Aliyu Gusau, Halilu Akilu, Mamman Vatsa, Gado Nasko, and younger officers from his days as an
  instructor in the military academy (graduates of the NDA's Regular Course 3), and gradually positioned his allies
  within the echelons of military hierarchy.<br>
  <span> <u> EXECUTION </u>    </span>  <br>
  The execution of the palace coup was initially delayed due to General Tunde Idiagbon the 6th Chief of Staff,
  Supreme Headquarters and ruthless second-in-command to General Muhammadu Buhari. At midnight on 27
  August 1985, the plot metamorphosed with four Majors: Sambo Dasuki, Abubakar Dangiwa Umar, Lawan
  Gwadabe, and Abdulmumini Aminu detailed to arrest the head of state. By daybreak, the conspirators had
  taken over the government and Babangida flew into Lagos from Minna where he was announced as the new
  commander-in-chief in a radio broadcast by General Sani Abacha. Babangida justified the coup in a speech
  describing General Muhammadu Buhari's military regime as "too rigid". <br>
  <span> <u> PROMULGATION </u>    </span>  <br>
  Babangida ruling by decree promulgated his official title as the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed
  Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and placed Muhammadu Buhari under house arrest in Benin until
  1988. He established the Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) as the highest law-making council serving as
  Chairman; he also restructured the national security apparatus, tasking General Aliyu Gusau as Co-ordinator of
  National Security directly reporting to him in the president's office he created the: State Security Service (SSS),
  National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA).<br>
  <span> <u> PRESIDENCY </u>    </span>  <br>
  Shortly after coming to power General Babangida established the Nigerian Political Bureau of 1986. The bureau
  was inaugurated to conduct a national debate on the political future of Nigeria, and was charged amongst other
  things to: <br>
  Review Nigeria’s political history and identify the basic problems which have led to our failure in
  the past and suggest ways of resolving and coping with these problems.<br>
  The exercise was the broadest political consultation conduced in Nigerian history<br>
  
  Between 1983 and 1985, the country suffered an economic crisis. In 1986, Babangida launched the Structural
  Adjustment Program (SAP), with support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, to
  restructure the Nigerian economy. In 1987, Babangida launched the Mass Mobilization for Self Reliance, Social
  Justice and Economic Recovery (MAMSER), following a recommendation from the Political Bureau, to increase
  self reliance and economic recovery. The policies involved in the SAP and MAMSER were:<br>
  <ul>
    <li> deregulation of the agricultural sector to include abolition of marketing boards and elimination of price
      controls</li> 
    <li> privatisation of public enterprises </li>
      <li>   devaluation of the Nigerian naira to improve the competitiveness of the export sector </li>
  <li>  relaxation of restraints on foreign investment put in place by the Gowon and Obasanjo governments
    during the 1970s.</li>
  <li>     re-orient Nigerians to shun waste and vanity, promoting economic recovery </li>
  <li>   shed all pretences of affluence in their lifestyle, promoting self reliance </li>
  <li> propagate the need to eschew all vices in public life, including corruption, dishonesty, electoral and census</li>
  <li> malpractices, ethnic and religious bigotry, promoting social justice
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  Between 1986 and 1988, these policies were executed as intended by the IMF, and the Nigerian economy
  actually did grow as had been hoped, with the export sector performing especially well. But falling real wages in
  the public sector and among the urban classes, along with a drastic reduction in expenditure on public services,
  set off waves of rioting and other manifestations of discontent that made sustained commitment to the SAP
  difficult to maintain.<br>
  Babangida contributed to the development of national infrastructure. He finished the construction of the Third
  Mainland Bridge, the largest bridge on the continent at the time. His administration also saw the completion of
  the dualising of the Kaduna-Kano highway. Babangida also completed the Shiroro Hydroelectric Power Station.
  He had the Toja Bridge in Kebbi constructed. He also created the Jibia Water Treatment Plant and the Challawa
  Cenga Dam in Kano. Babangida also founded the Federal Road Safety Corps in order to better manage the
  national roads. On 23 September 1987, Babangida created two states: Akwa Ibom State and Katsina State. On 27
  August 1991, Babangida created nine more states: Abia, Enugu, Delta, Jigawa, Kebbi, Osun, Kogi, Taraba and
  Yobe. Bringing the total number of states in Nigeria to thirty in 1991. Babangida also increased the share of
  oil royalties and rents to state of origin from 1.5 to 3 percent.
   Babangida and his Ministers of the Federal
  Capital Territory led by Mamman Vatsa, Hamza Abdullahi and later General Gado Nasko, led the regime's
  relocation of the seat of government from Lagos to Abuja on 12 December 1991.<br>
  Babangida strengthened the foreign relations of Nigeria. He rejected apartheid in South Africa, involved
  Nigerian troops in the Liberian Civil War, hosted the Abuja Treaty which gave rise to the African Union and
  enhanced relations with the United States and United Kingdom.
   In 1986, Nigeria joined the Organisation of
  Islamic Cooperation an international organisation considered the "collective voice of the Muslim world". This
  move was welcomed in Northern Nigeria, where there is a Muslim majority population. However non-Muslims
  criticised the move likening it to an Islamisation agenda of Nigeria, a secular country. Babangida's then secondin-command Commodore Ebitu Okoh Ukiwe, opposed the decision to join the Islamic organization and was
  removed as Chief of General Staff.
   Close to the end of his tenure, he paid a state visit to the queen of the
  United Kingdom making him the second Nigerian leader after Yakubu Gowon to do so.<br>
  <span> <u> CRISIS OF THE THIRD REPUBLIC </u>    </span>  <br>
  In 1989, Babangida started making plans for the transition to the Third Nigerian Republic. He legalized the
  formation of political parties and formed the two-party system with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and
  National Republican Convention (NRC) ahead of the 1992 general elections. He urged all Nigerians to join
  either of the parties, which the late Chief Bola Ige famously referred to as "two leper hands." The two-party state
  had been a Political Bureau recommendation. In November 1991, after a census was conducted, the National
  Electoral Commission (NEC) announced on 24 January 1992 that both legislative elections to a bicameral
  National Assembly and a presidential election would be held later that year. A process of voting was adopted,
  referred to as Option A4. This process advocated that any candidate needed to pass through adoption for all
  elective positions from the local government, state government and federal government.<br>
  The 1992 parliamentary election went ahead as planned, with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) winning
  majorities in both houses of the National Assembly, but on 7 August 1992, the NEC annulled the first round of
  1992 presidential primaries. Babangida annulled the 7 August presidential primaries which Shehu Yar'Adua
  emerged as the SDP presidential candidate and Adamu Ciroma as the NRC candidate order to get rid of the old
  guard in both parties. In January 1993, Babangida rejigged the ruling military junta – the AFRC – replacing it
  with the National Defence and Security Council, as the supreme decision-making organ of the regime. He also
  appointed Ernest Shonekan Head of the Transitional Council and de jure Head of Government. At the time, the
  transitional council was designed to be the final phase leading to a scheduled hand over to an elected democratic
  leader in the slated for 1993 presidential election.<br>
  On 12 June 1993, the presidential election was finally held. The results though not officially declared by the
  National Electoral Commission – showed the duo of Moshood Abiola and Babagana Kingibe of the Social
  Democratic Party (SDP) defeated Bashir Tofa and Slyvester Ugoh of the National Republican Convention
  (NRC) by over 2.3 million votes in the 1993 presidential election. The elections were later annulled by military
  head of state General Babangida, citing electoral irregularities. The annulment led to widespread protests and
  political unrest in Abiola's stronghold of the South West, as many felt Babangida had ulterior motives, and did
  not want to cede power to Moshood Abiola, a Yoruba businessman. Babangida later admitted that the elections
  were annulled due to national security considerations,which he didn't specify.<br>
  The lingering June 12 crisis led to the resignation of General Babangida in August 1993. Babangida signed a
  decree establishing the Interim National Government led by Ernest Shonekan. As interim president, Shonekan
  initially appointed Abiola as his Vice President, who refused to recognize the interim government, the crisis
  lingered for months culminating in the seizure of power of General Sani Abacha. Babangida at the height of the
  crisis stated "If I am sleeping and I hear the Yorubas beating the drums of war, I would go back to sleep."<br>
  <span> <u> POST PRESIDENCY </u>    </span>  <br>
  From his hilltop residence in Minna, Babangida has cultivated a patronage system which cuts across the entire
  country. In 1998, Babangida was instrumental in the transition to democracy. Babangida is one of the founders of
  the Peoples Democratic Party alongside other prominent military generals such as Aliyu Mohammed Gusau.
  They were said to have supported General Olusegun Obasanjo in the 1999 Nigerian presidential election in order
  to springboard themselves back to power.<br>
  In August 2006, Babangida announced that he would run in the 2007 Nigerian presidential election.He said he was doing so "under the banner of the Nigerian people" and accused the country's political elite of
  fuelling Nigeria's current ethnic and religious violence. On 8 November 2006, General Babangida picked up
  a nomination form from the Peoples Democratic Party headquarters in Abuja. This effectively put to rest any
  speculation about his ambitions to run for the Presidency. His form was personally issued to him by the PDP
  chairman, Ahmadu Ali. This action immediately drew extreme reactions of support or opposition from the south
  west. In December, just before the presidential primaries, it was widely reported in Nigerian newspapers that
  Babangida had withdrawn his candidacy. In a letter excerpted in the media, IBB is quoted as citing the "moral
  dilemma" of running against Umaru Yar'Adua, the younger brother of the late General Shehu Yar'Adua, as well
  as against General Aliyu Mohammed Gusau, given IBB's close relationship with the latter two. It is widely
  believed that his chances of winning were slim.<br>
  In September 2010, Babangida officially declared his intention to run for the presidency in the 2011 presidential
  election in Abuja, Nigeria. Babangida was later urged by his military inner circle to withdraw his candidacy
   after the October 2010 Abuja bombing. President Goodluck Jonathan later emerged as the PDP presidential
   candidate and throughout his presidency sought counsel from Babangida and his military inner circle.<br>
   In 2015, following the election of his long-time rival General Muhammadu Buhari as President, Babangida has
   maintained a low profile. In 2017, Babangida had a corrective surgery. He is considered a foremost elder
   statesman, and has called for a generational shift in leadership to allow for a new crop of leaders to replace the
   1966 military class.<br>
   <span> <u> PERSONAL LIFE </u>    </span>  <br>
   A biopic titled Badamasi: Portrait of a General which chronicled his early life, life during the Nigerian civil war
  as well as his time as the military head of state was produced by Obi Emelonye and released in cinemas on 12
  June 2020.<br>
  <span> <u> FAMILY </u>    </span>  <br>
  Babangida was married to Maryam Babangida from 1969 until her death in 2009. They had four children
  together; Aisha, Muhammad, Aminu, and Halima. On 27 December 2009, Maryam Babangida died from
  complications of ovarian cancer.<br>
  <span> <u> PERSONAL WEALTH </u>    </span>  <br>
  Babangida is rumoured to be worth over US$5 billion.
   He is believed to secretly possess a multi-billion
  dollar fortune via successive ownership of stakes in a number of Nigerian companies.<br>
  Magazine Forbes assumed in 2011 that shortly before the Second Gulf War Babangida channelled US$12 billion
  of unplanned profits ("oil windfall") into his own pocket (the oil price jumped from 15 USD/barrel to 41.15
  USD/barrel within weeks in 1990 and then crashed almost as quickly to the old value).
   Investigations into this
  did not lead to any concrete results. A critical remark is that the additional profit of USD 12 billion calculated
  by Forbes could only have been realised if Nigeria had sold the entire annual production volume of 630 million
  barrels exactly on 27 September 1990 at the annual peak price of 41 USD/barrel - instead of the officially stated
  22 USD/barrel average during the whole year. This is unlikely in view of the long-term supply contracts in
  the oil business and the sluggishness of the state-owned oil company NNPC. Babangida commented in 2022 on
  the above allegations that he and his staff had been "saints".[46] This account should be assessed with as much
  caution as Forbes' calculation. <br>

        <span> <u> LATER CAREER </u>    </span>  <br>
        Abubakar, an ethnic Hausa, was born on 13 June 1942 to his father Abubakar Jibrin and his mother Fatikande
        Mohammed, in Minna, Niger State, Nigeria.<br>
        From 1950 to 1956 he attended Minna Native Authority Primary school. From 1957 to 1962, he had his
        secondary school education at Government College, Bida, Niger State. From January to October 1963, he
        studied at Kaduna Technical College.<br>
        <span> <u> MILITARY CAREERS </u>    </span>  <br>
        <span> <u> AIR FORCE CAREER </u>    </span>  <br>
        Abubakar is a member of the pioneering sets of officer cadets who enlisted into the Nigerian Air force on 3
        October 1963. From 1964- 1966, he was flown to Uetersen, West Germany with a team of officer cadets, for
        Basic and Advance Military Training. When he returned to Nigeria in 1966, he was seconded to the Nigerian
        Army.<br>
        <span> <u>  CAREER IN THE ARMY </u>    </span>  <br>
        After joining the army in 1966 as an officer cadet, Abubakar attended the emergency combatant short service
        course two. In October 1967, Abubakar was commissioned second lieutenant, infantry division, Nigerian army.
        From 1967 to 1968, Abubakar was general staff officer two, second garrison, and commanding officer, 92
        infantry battalion from 1969 to 1974. Between 1974 and 1975, he was made brigade major, 7th infantry brigade.
        In 1975 he served as commanding officer, 84 infantry battalion. In 1978–1979, Abubakar was commanding
        officer for the 145 infantry battalion (NIBATT II), United Nations Interim force, Lebanon.<br>
        In 1979 he was made assistant adjutant general 3rd Infantry division, Nigeria. From 1980 to 1982, Abubakar was
        chief instructor at the Nigerian Defence Academy. In 1982 he was appointed as the colonel of administration and
        quartering, 1st mechanised division. A position he held up until 1984. From 1985 to 1986, Abubakar was the
        commander 3rd mechanised brigade. He served as the military secretary of the army, 1986–1988. Abubakar was
        made general officer commanding 1st mechanised division 1990–1991. Between 1991 and 1993, he was the
        principal staff officer, as the army chief of plan and policy, Defence Headquarters.<br>
        From 1997 to 1998, General Sani Abacha appointed Abubakar as the Chief of Defence Staff. Upon Abacha's
        death on 8 June 1998, one day later Abubakar was named military President and Commander in Chief of the
        Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.<br>
        <span> <u>  PRESIDENCY</u>    </span>  <br>
        <span> <u>  MILITARY </u>    </span>  <br>
        Nigeria had been ruled by military leaders since Muhammadu Buhari seized power from Shehu Shagari in a
        1983 coup. Although democratic elections had been held in 1993, they were annulled by General Ibrahim
        Babangida. Reported to have had an initial reluctance to accepting the position,Abubakar was sworn in as
        president on 9 June 1998 after the unexpected death of Abacha. He declared a weeklong period of national
        mourning.<br>
        <span> <u>  POLITICS </u>    </span>  <br>
        A few days after assuming office, Abubakar promised to hold elections within a year and transfer power to an
        elected president. He established the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), appointing former
        Supreme Court Justice Ephraim Akpata as chairman.The INEC held a series of elections first for Local
        Government Areas in December 1998, then for State Assemblies and Governors, National Assemblies and
        finally for the President on 27 February 1999. Although efforts were made to ensure that the elections were free
        and fair, there were widespread irregularities that drew criticism from foreign observers.<br>
        <span> <u>  TRANSFORM OF POWER </u>    </span>  <br>
        Surprising some critics of the country's military, in May 1999 General Abubakar handed over power to the newly elected civilian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, and retired from the army.<br>
        <span> <u>  LEGACY </u>    </span>  <br>
        Abubakar's legacy is mixed. A lecture circuit at Chicago State University in Chicago, Illinois, United States
        featuring him encountered opposition, because he had supported Abacha's government.(Abacha'sadministration was notorious for its human rights abuses).[11][12]
        He was also sued in that country by other Nigerians who claimed he was responsible for the death of 1993 president-elect Moshood Kashimawo Olawale
        Abiola, who died in custody after being prevented by the military from taking office, and for the violation of the
        rights of others during his administration.Abubakar helped in the Liberian peace movement by presiding
        over the 2003 peace talks between Charles Taylor and the opposing rebels. This is seen in the movie Pray the
        Devil Back to Hell. Abubakar also chaired the Commonwealth Observer Group to the Zimbabwe presidential
        election in 2002, which concluded that "the conditions in Zimbabwe did not adequately allow for a free
        expression of will by the electors.<br>
        <span> <u>  PERSONAL LIFE </u>    </span>  <br>
        Abubakar is married to Fati and they have six children together.<br>

 (16 November 1904 – 11 May 1996),usually referred to as "Zik", was a Nigerian statesman, revolutionary and political leader who served as the 3rd governor-general of Nigeria between 1960 and 1963 and the 1st president of Nigeria during the First Nigerian Republic which existed from 1963 to 1966.Considered a driving force behind the nation's independence, he came to be known as the "father of Nigerian nationalism".
Born to Igbo parents from Anambra State, Eastern Nigeria in Zungeru in present-day Niger State. As a young boy, he learned to speak Hausa (the main indigenous language of the Northern Region).Azikiwe was later sent to live with his aunt and grandmother in Onitsha (his parental homeland), where he learned the Igbo language. A stay in Lagos exposed him to the Yoruba language; by the time he was in college, he had been exposed to different Nigerian cultures and spoke three languages (an asset as president).
Azikiwe travelled to the United States where he was known as Ben Azikiwe and attended Storer College, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and Howard University. He contacted colonial authorities with a request to represent Nigeria at the Los Angeles Olympics. He returned to Africa in 1934, where he began work as a journalist in the Gold Coast. In British West Africa, he advocated Nigerian and African nationalism as a journalist and a political leader.<br>
<span> <u> EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION</u></span>  <br>
Azikiwe was born on 16 November 1904 in Zungeru, Northern Nigeria. His first name means "my father is alive" in Igbo language, as his parents were Igbo. His father, Obed-Edom Chukwuemeka Azikiwe(1879–3 March 1958), a native of Onitsha, was a clerk in the British Administration of Nigeria, who traveled extensively as part of his job. Azikiwe's mother was Rachel Chinwe Ogbenyeanu (Aghadiuno) Azikiwe (1883 – January 1958),who was sometimes called Nwanonaku and was the third daughter of Aghadiuno Ajie. Her family descended from a royal family in Onitsha, and her paternal great-grandfather was Obi (Ugogwu) Anazenwu. Azikiwe had one sibling, a sister, named Cecilia Eziamaka Arinze.<br>
As a young boy, Azikiwe spoke Hausa, the regional language. His father, concerned about his son's fluency in Hausa and not Igbo, sent him to Onitsha in 1912 to live with his paternal grandmother and aunt to learn the Igbo language and culture.In Onitsha, Azikiwe attended Holy Trinity School (a Roman Catholic mission school) and Christ Church School (an Anglican primary school).In 1914, while his father was working in Lagos, Azikiwe was bitten by a dog; this prompted his worried father to ask him to come to Lagos to heal and to attend school in the city. He then attended Wesleyan Boys' High School, now known as Methodist Boys’ High School, Broad Street Lagos. His father was sent to Kaduna two years later, and Azikiwe briefly lived with a relative who was married to a Muslim from Sierra Leone. In 1918, he was back in Onitsha and finished his secondary education at CMS Central School.Azikiwe then worked at the school as a student-teacher, supporting his mother with his earnings. In 1920, his father was posted back to southern Nigeria in the southeastern city of Calabar. Azikiwe joined his father in Calabar, beginning tertiary education at the Hope Waddell Training College. He was introduced to the teachings of Marcus Garvey, Garveyism, which became an important part of his nationalistic rhetoric.<br>
After attending Hope Waddell,Azikiwe was transferred to Methodist Boys' High School in Lagos and befriended classmates from old Lagos families such as George Shyngle, Francis Cole and Ade Williams (a son of the Akarigbo of Remo). These connections were later beneficial to his political career in Lagos. Azikiwe heard a lecture by James Aggrey, an educator who believed that Africans should receive a college education abroad and return to effect change. After the lecture, Aggrey gave the young Azikiwe a list of schools accepting black students in America. After completing his secondary education, Azikiwe applied to the colonial service and was accepted as a clerk in the' treasury department. His time in the colonial service exposed him to racial bias in the colonial government. Determined to travel abroad for further education, Azikiwe applied to universities in the U.S. He was admitted by Storer College, contingent on his finding a way to America. To reach America, he contacted a seaman and made a deal with him to become a stowaway.However, one of his friends on the ship became ill and they were advised to disembark in Sekondi. In Ghana, Azikiwe worked as a police officer; his mother visited, and asked him to return to Nigeria. He returned, and his father was willing to sponsor his trip to America.<br>
Azikiwe attended Storer College's two-year preparatory school in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. To fund his living expenses and tuition, he worked a number of menial jobs before enrolling in Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1927 to obtain a bachelor's degree in political science. In 1929, he transferred from Howard University to Lincoln University to complete his undergraduate studies and graduated in 1930 with a BA in political science. Azikwe took courses with Alain Locke.Azikiwe was a member of Phi Beta Sigma. He then enrolled at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and in the University of Pennsylvania simultaneously in 1930, receiving a master's degree in religion from Lincoln University and a master's degree in anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1932. Azikiwe became a graduate-student instructor in the history and political-science departments at Lincoln University, where he created a course in African history. He was a candidate for a doctoral degree at Columbia University before returning to Nigeria in 1934. Azikiwe's doctoral research focused on Liberia in world politics, and his research paper was published by A. H. Stockwell in 1934. During his time in America, he was a columnist for the Baltimore Afro-American, Philadelphia Tribune and the Associated Negro Press. Azikiwe was influenced by the ideals of the African-American press, Garveyism and pan-Africanism.<br>
<span> <u> NEWSPAPER CAREER</u></span>  <br>

He applied as a foreign-service official for Liberia, but was rejected because he was not a native of the country. By 1934, when Azikiwe returned to Lagos, he was well-known and viewed as a public figure by some members of the Lagos and Igbo community. He was welcomed home by a number of people, as his writings in America evidently reached Nigeria. In Nigeria, Azikiwe's initial goal was to obtain a position commensurate with his education; after several unsuccessful applications (including for a teaching post at King's College), he accepted an offer from Ghanaian businessman Alfred Ocansey to become founding editor of the African Morning Post (a new daily newspaper in Accra, Ghana). He was given a free hand to run the newspaper, and recruited many of its original staff.Azikiwe wrote "The Inside Stuff by Zik", a column in which he preached radical nationalism and black pride which raised some alarm in colonial circles. As editor, he promoted a pro-African nationalist agenda. Yuri Smertin described his writing there: "In his passionately denunciatory articles and public statements he censured the existing colonial order: the restrictions on the African's right to express their opinions, and racial discrimination. He also criticized those Africans who belonged to the 'elite' of colonial society and favoured retaining the existing order, as they regarded it as the basis of their well-being."  During Azikiwe's stay in Accra he advanced his New Africa philosophy later explored in his book, Renascent Africa. The philosophic ideal is a state where Africans would be divorced from ethnic affiliations and traditional authorities and transformed by five philosophical pillars: spiritual balance, social regeneration, economic determinism, mental emancipation and risorgimento nationalism. Azikiwe did not shy away from Gold Coast politics, and the paper supported the local Mambii party.<br>

The Post published a 15 May 1936 article, "Has the African a God?" by I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson, and Azikiwe (as editor) was tried for sedition. He was originally found guilty and sentenced to six months in prison, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. Azikiwe returned to Lagos in 1937 and founded the West African Pilot, a newspaper which he used to promote nationalism in Nigeria. In addition to the Pilot, his Zik Group established newspapers in politically- and economically important cities throughout the country.The group's flagship newspaper was the West African Pilot, which used Dante Alighieri's "Show the light and the people will find the way" as its motto. Other publications were the Southern Nigeria Defender from Warri (later Ibadan), the Eastern Guardian (founded in 1940 and published in Port Harcourt), and the Nigerian Spokesman in Onitsha. In 1944, the group acquired Dusé Mohamed Ali's The Comet. Azikiwe's newspaper venture was a business and political tool.The Pilot focused less on advertising than on circulation, largely because expatriate firms dominated the Nigerian economy. Many of Azikiwe's newspapers emphasized sensationalism and human-interest stories; the Pilot introduced sports coverage and a women's section, increasing coverage of Nigerian events compared with the competing Daily Times (which emphasized expatriate and foreign-news-service stories). The Pilot's initial run was 6,000 copies daily; at its peak in 1950, it was printing over 20,000 copies. Azikiwe founded other business ventures (such as the African Continental Bank and the Penny Restaurant) at this time, and used his newspapers to advertise them.<br>

Before World War II, the West African Pilot  was seen as a paper trying to build a circulation base rather than overtly radical. The paper's editorials and political coverage focused on injustice to Africans, criticism of the colonial administration and support for the ideas of the educated elites in Lagos. However, by 1940 a gradual change occurred. As he did in the African Morning Post, Azikiwe began writing a column ("Inside Stuff") in which he sometimes tried to raise political consciousness. Pilot editorials called for African independence, particularly after the rise of the Indian independence movement. Although the paper supported Great Britain during the war, it criticized austerity measures such as price controls and wage ceilings. In 1943 the British Council sponsored eight West African editors (including Azikiwe), and he and six other editors used the opportunity to raise awareness of possible political independence. The journalists signed a memorandum calling for gradual socio-political reforms, including abrogation of the crown colony system, regional representation and independence for British West African colonies by 1958 or 1960. The memorandum was ignored by the colonial office, increasing Azikiwe's militancy.<br>

He had a controlling interest in over 12 daily, African-run newspapers. Azikiwe's articles on African nationalism, black pride and empowerment dismayed many colonialist politicians and benefited many marginalized Africans. East African newspapers generally published in Swahili, with the exception of newsletters such as the East African Standard. Azikiwe revolutionized the West African newspaper industry, demonstrating that English-language journalism could be successful. By 1950, the five leading African-run newspapers in the Eastern Region (including the Nigerian Daily Times) were outsold by the Pilot. On 8 July 1945, the Nigerian government banned Azikiwe's West African Pilot and Daily Comet for misrepresenting information about a general strike. Although Azikiwe acknowledged this, he continued publishing articles about the strike in the Guardian (his Port Harcourt newsletter). He led a 1945 general strike, and was the premier of East Nigeria from 1954 to 1959. By the 1960s, after Nigerian independence, the national West African Pilot was particularly influential in the east. Azikiwe took particular aim at political groups which advocated exclusion. He was criticized by a Yoruba faction for using his newspaper to suppress opposition to his views. At Azikiwe's death, The New York Times said that he "towered over the affairs of Africa's most populous nation, attaining the rare status of a truly national hero who came to be admired across the regional and ethnic lines dividing his country."<br>
<span> <u> POLITICAL CAREER</u></span>  <br>

Azikiwe became active in the Nigerian Youth Movement (NYM), the country's first nationalist organization.  Although he supported Samuel Akisanya as the NYM candidate for a vacant seat in the Legislative Council in 1941, the NYM executive council selected Ernest Ikoli.<br>

Azikiwe resigned from the NYM, accusing the majority Yoruba leadership of discriminating against the Ijebu-Yoruba members and Igbos. Some Ijebu members followed him, splitting the movement along ethnic lines.  He entered politics, co-founding the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) with Herbert Macaulay in 1944. Azikiwe became the council's secretary-general in 1946.<br>
<span> <u> CONSPIRACY ALLEGATIONS AND ZIKIST MOVEMENT</u></span>  <br>
As a result of Azikiwe's support for a general strike in June 1945 and his attacks on the colonial government, publication of the West African Pilot was suspended on 8 July of that year. He praised the striking workers and their leader, Michael Imoudu, accusing the colonial government of exploiting the working class.  In August, the newspaper was allowed to resume publication. During the strike, Azikiwe raised the alarm about an assassination plot by unknown individuals working on behalf of the colonial government.  His basis for the allegation was a wireless message intercepted by a Pilot reporter.  After receiving the intercepted message, Azikiwe went into hiding in Onitsha. The Pilot published sympathetic editorials during his absence, and many Nigerians believed the assassination story. Azikiwe's popularity, and his newspaper circulation, increased during this period. The allegations were doubted by some Nigerians, who believed that he made them up to raise his profile.  The skeptics were primarily Yoruba politicians from the Nigerian Youth Movement, creating a rift between the factions and a press war between Azikiwe's Pilot and the NYM's Daily Service.<br>

A militant youth movement, led by Osita Agwuna, Raji Abdalla, Kolawole Balogun, M. C. K. Ajuluchukwu and Abiodun Aloba, was established in 1946 to defend Azikiwe's life and his ideals of self-government.  Inspired by his writings and Nwafor Orizu's Zikism philosophy, members of the movement soon began advocating positive, militant action to bring about self-government.  Calls for action included strikes, study of military science by Nigerian students overseas, and a boycott of foreign products. Azikiwe did not publicly defend the movement, which was banned in 1951 after a failed attempt to kill a colonial secretary.<br>
<span> <u> OPPOSITION TO RICHARDS CONSTITUTION</u></span>  <br>


In 1945, British governor Arthur Richards presented proposals for a revision of the Clifford constitution of 1922. Included in the proposal was an increase in the number of nominated African members to the Legislative Council. However, the changes were opposed by nationalists such as Azikiwe.  NCNC politicians opposed unilateral decisions made by Arthur Richards and a constitutional provision allowing only four elected African members; the rest would be nominated candidates.  The nominated African candidates were loyal to the colonial government, and would not aggressively seek self-government. Another basis of opposition was little input for the advancement of Africans to senior civil-service positions. The NCNC prepared to argue its case to the new Labour government of Clement Attlee in Britain. A tour of the country was begun to raise awareness of the party's concerns and to raise money for the UK protest.  NCNC president Herbert Macaulay died during the tour, and Azikiwe assumed leadership of the party. He led the delegation to London and, in preparation for the trip, traveled to the US to seek sympathy for the party's case. Azikiwe met Eleanor Roosevelt at Hyde Park, and spoke about the "emancipation of Nigeria from political thralldom, economic insecurity and social disabilities". The UK delegation included Azikiwe, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, Zanna Dipcharima, Abubakar Olorunimbe, P. M. Kale, Adeleke Adedoyin and Nyong Essien. They visited the Fabian Society's Colonial Bureau, the Labor Imperial Committee and the West African Students' Union to raise awareness of its proposals for amendments to the 1922 constitution. Included in the NCNC proposals was consultation with Africans about changes to the Nigerian constitution, more power to the regional House of Assemblies and limiting the powers of the central Legislative Council to defense, currency and foreign affairs. The delegation submitted its proposals to the colonial secretary, but little was done to change to Richards' proposals. The Richards constitution took effect in 1947, and Azikiwe contested one of the Lagos seats to delay its implementation.<br>
<span> <u> 1950-1953</u></span>  <br>

Under the Richards constitution, Azikiwe was elected to the Legislative Council in a Lagos municipal election from the National Democratic Party (an NCNC subsidiary).He and the party representative did not attend the first session of the council, and agitation for changes to the Richards constitution led to the Macpherson constitution.  The Macpherson constitution took effect in 1951 and, like the Richards constitution, called for elections to the regional House of Assembly. Azikiwe opposed the changes, and contested for the chance to change the new constitution. Staggered elections were held from August to December 1951. In the Western Region (where Azikiwe stood), two parties were dominant: Azikiwe's NCNC and the Action Group. Elections for the Western Regional Assembly were held in September and December 1951 because the constitution allowed an electoral college to choose members of the national legislature; an Action Group majority in the house might prevent Azikiwe from going to the House of Representatives.  He won a regional assembly seat from Lagos, but the opposition party claimed a majority in the House of Assembly and Azikiwe did not represent Lagos in the federal House of Representatives. In 1951, he became leader of the Opposition to the government of Obafemi Awolowo in the Western Region's House of Assembly. Azikiwe's non-selection to the national assembly caused chaos in the west. An agreement by elected NCNC members from Lagos to step down for Azikiwe if he was not nominated broke down. Azikiwe blamed the constitution, and wanted changes made. The NCNC (which dominated the Eastern Region) agreed, and committed to amending the constitution.<br>

Azikiwe moved to the Eastern Region in 1952, and the NCNC-dominated regional assembly made proposals to accommodate him. Although the party's regional and central ministers were asked to resign in a cabinet reshuffle, most ignored the request.  The regional assembly then passed a vote of no confidence on the ministers, and appropriation bills sent to the ministry were rejected.  This created an impasse in the region, and the lieutenant governor dissolved the regional house. A new election returned Azikiwe as a member of the Eastern Assembly. He was selected as Chief Minister, and became premier of Nigeria's Eastern Region in 1954 when it became a federating unit.<br>
<span> <u> NIGERIA INDEPENDENCE</u></span>  <br>

On 1 October 1960, Nigeria gained independence from the British Colony. The British Union Jack was lowered and replaced by the nation's Green-white-green flag. A new constitution, establishing a federal system with an elected prime minister and a ceremonial head of state was created. The coalition government of NCNC and NPC was in power when Nigeria attained independence in 1960 with Sir Tafawa Balewa as Prime Minister and Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe as Senate President. Soon after, Azikiwe succeeded Sir James Robertson as the first indigenous Governor-General. However, under the Independent Constitution of Nigeria, the governor-general was only a ceremonial head of state with no executive power. The positions of Governor-General and membership of the Queen's Privy Council placed Azikiwe above party politics. Sir Tafawa Balewa delivered a speech at Race Course (now Tafawa Balewa Square) in Lagos at the Independence Ceremony. In his speech he said, "Today’s ceremony marks the culmination of a process which began fifteen years ago and has now reached a happy and successful conclusion. It is with justifiable pride that we claim the achievement of our Independence to be unparalleled in the annals of history. Each step of our constitutional advance has been purposefully and peacefully planned with full and open consultation, not only between representatives of all the various interests in Nigeria but in harmonious cooperation with the administering power which has today relinquished its authority.<br>
<span> <u> GOVERNOR GENERAL</u></span>  <br>
During the visit of the British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan to Lagos in early 1960, he convinced the then Nigerian Prime Minister to appoint Azikiwe as the successor to Sir James Robertson. Azikiwe's inauguration in November 1960, witnessed some of his colleagues in the Black Atlantic, some of them which includes Langston Hughes, Nina Simone, Dr. Horace Mann Bond, Ralph Bunche, W.E.B. Du Bois, Shirley Graham Du Bois, Amy Jacques Garvey, and George S. Schuyler. In his inauguration speech, Zik commented on “the need to revive the stature of man in Africa and restore the dignity of man in the world.” Towards the end of his address, Zik said, “those of us, who may be rightly described as the makers of contemporary Nigeria, have ushered freedom into our country and preserved our unity as a nation,” which “history has assigned to me an important part to play in order that this unity may have lasting effects and to bring home to our people the need to maintain it religiously.” He also said “I shall not have consideration for personal comforts or even safety or even life itself, if these are the price I must pay for leadership in order to preserve the freedom and unity of my country.<br>

On 17 November 1961, in a speech at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka, Zik made public his proposal for Nigeria to adopt a republican constitution while remaining a member of the Commonwealth. In 1962, Azikiwe urged African leaders in a Lagos conference, to create an organization of African states, stating that each state should not interfere with the affairs of each other. The Lagos Conference drafted a proposed charter for an “Inter-African and Malagasy Organization" under Azikiwe's chairmanship. It was later adopted in May 1963 by the Organisation of African Unity.<br>
<span> <u> PRESIDENCY, POST PRESIDENCY AND LATER LIFE</u></span>  <br>

When Nigeria became a republic in 1963, Azikiwe became its first president, though his role was largely ceremonial.<br>

He and his civilian colleagues were removed from office in the 15 January 1966 military coup, and he was the most prominent politician to avoid assassination after the coup. Azikiwe was a spokesman for Biafra and advised its leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, during the Biafran War (1967–1970).[103] He switched his allegiance back to Nigeria during the war, and appealed to Ojukwu to end the war in pamphlets and interviews. The New York Times said about his politics, "Throughout his life, Dr. Azikiwe's alliance with northerners put him at odds with Obafemi Awolowo, a socialist-inclined leader of the Yoruba, the country's other important southern group.<br>

After the war, Azikiwe was chancellor of the University of Lagos from 1972 to 1976. He joined the Nigerian People's Party in 1978, making unsuccessful bids for the presidency in 1979 and 1983. He left politics involuntarily after the 31 December 1983 military coup<br>
<span> <u> LATER LIFE</u></span>  <br>
Azikiwe died on 11 May 1996, at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital in Enugu after a prolonged illness. He was 91, and was buried in his native Onitsha on November 16, 1996, on what would have become his 92nd birthday. Azikiwe was given a state funeral by the government of Sani Abacha. In 2019, the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari undertook the completion of Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe Mausoluem and was declared a National monument.<br>

He established the University of Nigeria, Nsukka in 1960, and Queen Elizabeth II appointed him to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.He was made Grand Commander of the Federal Republic (GCFR), Nigeria's highest national honour, in 1980.<br>
<span> <u> ZIKISM</u></span>  <br>

Zikism is the political ideology of Nnamdi Azikiwe, aimed at decolonizing the minds of young Africans. At a time, when African states were under the British hegemony, Zik developed his political philosophy as a reformist ideology. The five canons of Zikism are “ Spiritual Balance,” “Social Regeneration,” “Economic Determinism,” “ Mental Emancipation,” and “Political Resurgence.”<br>
<span> <u> SPORTS</u></span>  <br>

Azikiwe competed in boxing, athletics, swimming, football and tennis.<br>

Football was brought to Nigeria by the British as they colonized Africa. However, any leagues that were formed were segregated. Nnamdi saw this as an injustice and he emerged as a leader in terms of connection sports and politics at the end of the colonial period. In 1934 Zik was denied the right to compete in a track and field event because Nigeria was not allowed to participate. This happened another time because of his Igbo background, and Zik had decided that enough was enough, and wanted to create his own club. Nnamdi founded Zik's Athletic Club (ZAC) which would open its doors to sportsmen and women of all races, nationalities, tribes, and classes of Nigeria. In 1942 the club went on to win both the Lagos League and the War Memorial Cup. After these victories, Nnamdi opened up more ZAC branches throughout Nigeria. During the war years ZAC would go on tours. They would usually play a match in front of a couple thousand fans and after the match, they would speak out about the injustices that was brought about by the British colonization. ZAC matches would happen all over the country, and it made the people of Nigeria feel a sense of unity and nationalism that would help them fight for freedom.In 1949 some ZAC players participated in a tour of England. On the return from the tour they stopped in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria defeated the locals by 2 goals. This victory was more than a decade before Nigerian independence, but it marked the birth of Nigeria's National Team. Finally, after years of struggle, in 1959 the last British official left the NFA, and on 22 August 1960, a few weeks prior to its formal independence, Nigeria joined the world football body of FIFA. None of this would have been possible if it was not for Nnamdi Azikiwe. He united Nigeria through sport and brought about a sense of nationalism that was referred to as ‘Nigerian-ness’.<br>
